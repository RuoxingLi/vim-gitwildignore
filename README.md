vim-gitwildignore
=================

Install and every file/directory in your project's ``.gitignore`` files will be
appended to your wildignore. Useful when accompanied with the
[ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) plugin.

## Installation
Use [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle), and add the following your ``vimrc`` file:
```vim
Bundle 'mikewadsten/vim-gitwildignore'
```

## Added features (versus [zdwolfe/vim-gitwildignore](https://github.com/zdwolfe/vim-gitwildignore))

  * Discovers `.gitignore` files in your repository automatically, without
    using `**/.gitignore` searching.
  * Buffer-local `wildignore` values - so you can switch between buffers
    without worrying about global state.

## TODO

  * Add support for ignore negations (leading `!` characters)
  * Investigate whether buffer-local `wildignore` is really necessary, given
    that the `.gitignore` entries have the directory path prepended to them.
  * Make sure this works right when exploring in netrw.
